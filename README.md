👋 Hi, I’m Thai An

👀 I’m passionate about software development, with a strong focus on JavaScript & TypeScript ecosystems.
🌱 I’m currently deepening my knowledge in NestJS and backend system design.

✌️ Recently, I’ve been working with:

  - Backend & Architecture

   - Medium to complex Microservices architectures
  
   - Event-driven systems and Message Queues (Redis, RabbitMQ)
  
   - Designing scalable and maintainable backend services

  - Databases
  
   - SQL: PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server
  
   - NoSQL: MongoDB, Elasticsearch

  - System Design

   - API design (REST / GraphQL)
  
   - Design systems & modular architecture
  
   - Performance, scalability, and maintainability considerations

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects where I can contribute real value, learn from experienced engineers, and continuously improve my skills.
